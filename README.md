TerraScriber is a map making tool that enables GMs/DMs or artists to quickly make attractive maps for their physical or virtual tabletop gaming.

TerraScriber has these features for players and game masters:

* Create grid-based maps using Tile Layers - an auto-tiling system to quickly lay out map geometry.
* Place non-grid-based Items to decorate maps using rotation, duplication, flipping, and draw order.
* Apply effects to maps to control things like color saturation, contrast, and more.
* Powerful map exporting for digital (VTT) or print use, automatically slicing the map into common print sizes.
* Share maps with others as either a source file or an exported image.
* Import custom content packs to make maps for a wide variety of grid-based tabletop games.
* Robust fantasy map-making pack built into the tool!
* Create and share your own tile and item packs.

We recommend [checking out our Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md) for a no-frills explanation of how TerraScriber works!
