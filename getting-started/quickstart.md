# Quickstart

TerraScriber makes it easy to create attractive maps for your virtual or tabletop gaming session! This page summarizes the overall workflow to create a map.

TerraScriber uses a grid-based system for creating maps that works nicely with most grid-based tabletop games. The default content that comes with TerraScriber assumes that a grid square is approximately five feet.

### Create A New Map

You can create a new map on the main title screen. Once created, the new map will automatically be given a filename and saved to disk. The new empty map will show up in the list of maps and will be available for editing.

### Editing Your Map

TerraScriber divides editing into two main modes: [Layers ](../creating-maps/editing-layers.md)and [Items](../creating-maps/editing-items.md).

Layers define the main "geometry" of your map and are grid based - things like floors, walls, pathways, rooms, and waterways.

Items are decorative map elements and are not grid based - things like tables, chairs, signposts, trees, and virtually anything else can be placed as an Item.

Items always render on top of Layers.

#### Camera Control

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. The current zoom is shown in the bottom left status bar.

Press middle mouse to drag/pan the map.

Holding the space key will also drag/pan the map if you are using a touchpad or do not have a middle click.

#### Saving Your Map

Once you create a map, it will automatically be saved constantly as you edit. Drawing Layer tiles, placing, duplicating, or repositioning items, and similar activities trigger a save.

{% hint style="info" %}
At this time, TerraScriber does not have undo functionality. Changing the name of your map in the Map Settings panel will save it to a new filename on disk and is the only way to make big changes safely. This is something we plan to address in a future version release.
{% endhint %}

#### Changing Map Effects

You can change the map name and apply effects to the overall look of your map in [Settings mode](../creating-maps/effects-and-settings.md).

The resizing feature is coming soon and will appear in the Map Settings panel.

#### Exporting Your Map

You can export your map at different scales using the [Export mode](quickstart.md#exporting-your-map).
