# Editing Items

Item Editing allows you to place non-grid-aligned items to decorate your map.

The following image shows tools unique to editing Items.

1. The Item selection cursor. Use this tool to edit and duplicate existing items.
2. The Item placement cursor. Use this tool to add new items to the map. `RIGHT CLICK` to return to editing existing items.
3. This text box filters the list of items based on the entered text.
4. The item list shows all items loaded from all available packs with a preview of the item.
5. Selected items will be outlined in magenta. The following keys edit your selected items:
   1. `RIGHT DRAG`: move the selected items
   2. `SHIFT CLICK`: add or remove from current selection
   3. `D`: duplicate the selection.
   4. `Z`: to rotate the selection, holding the SHIFT key will rotate in smaller increments.
   5. `X`: to flip the selection.
   6. `ARROWS`: nudge the selection, nudging also snaps the item to the nearest pixel, which is helpful for precisely aligning items such as railroad tracks.
   7. `+`: increase item layer.
   8. `-`: decrease item layer.
   9. `DELETE`: delete the selection (**this action has no undo**)
6. The cursor, when in placement mode, the item-to-be-placed will show faintly below the cursor.
