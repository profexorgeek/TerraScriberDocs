# Editor Overview

Editing in TerraScriber has four modes. First, creators typically create and edit Layers to form their main map geometry. Next, creators add and arrange Items to decorate their map. Then, they edit the Settings to control the overall color tone and effects, Finally, they export their map to print or use in their favorite VTT.
