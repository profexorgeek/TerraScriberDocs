# v1.1.X

v1.1 adds new art, a lot of quality-of-life improvement, and starts adding some critical features that didn't make the v1.0 release (map resizing!). Here's a list of features and bugfixes that shipped in v1.1.

### Community Bugs & Requests

* Entering non-numeric characters in mouse creation
* Double-clicking a map now loads the map immediately
* Unresolvable tiles now render as a self-contained tile instead of an ugly square
* Select all (`CTRL A`) now works correctly in text boxes
* Placing vs selecting items is now clearer, easier to swap between
* The tile selection rectangle no longer gets stuck when released over UI
* Clicking while "Map has no layers" dialog is active no longer crashes
* Clicking "Delete Map" while the map list is empty no longer crashes
* Clicking visibility icon while map has no layers no longer crashes
* New maps now show the grid by default
* Map now has a bounding rectangle, even when grid is off, so you can always see the map borders

### Roadmap Features

* Gr**id color is now editable!**
* **Maps can now be resized!**
* **Item filtering performance/responsiveness has improved by about 40x!**
* Nudging items with arrow keys now snaps to nearest pixel (helps precisely align to whole pixels which is critical for aligning things like railroad tracks)
* Clicking an item in the item list switches to item placement
* Right clicking in item placement mode switches back to selecting items
* Right clicking in layer mode switches between add and remove tiles
* Item selection is more intelligent, selecting the topmost item and adding or removing to the current selection is more intuitive
* Selection rectangle no longer appears under items sometimes
